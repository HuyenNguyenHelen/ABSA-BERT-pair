            "With its definitions of \\&quot;partially complete receiver\\&quot; and \\&quot;readily,\\&quot; ATF 2021R-05 would codify arbitrary and capricious classification standards. The vague definition of \\&quot;partially complete receiver\\&quot; contains still more vague definitions, like \\&quot;clearly identifiable\\&quot;, \\&quot;unfinished component part of a weapon\\&quot;, \\&quot;critical stage of manufacture\\&quot;, \\&quot;sufficiently complete to function\\&quot;, and \\&quot;primordial state.\\&quot;  The new definition of \\&quot;readily\\&quot; contains so many factors, and of such ambiguous weight and meaning, that the test can only be meant to confuse and intimidate non-FFL entities before ATF\\&#39;s awesome authority. The multi-factor test for \\&quot;readily\\&quot; amounts to lawless Caesarism, and invests the ATF Director with more power than Congress has authorized. ATF would like to legitimize its wholly arbitrary sample submission process-- one which is not derived from the GCA, and which ATF emphasizes does not even obligate them to respond. This is a farcical and irregular process that lacks any pretense of Fifth Amendment protection, and, by literal definition, gives the Director unlimited discretion.<br/><br/>Did ATF examine relevant data?<br/>No. ATF admits in this rule\\&#39;s Regulatory Impact Analysis, Chapter 3, that it did not attempt to collect the relevant data on \\&quot;partially complete\\&quot; receiver and kit sales. ATF has no idea how much commerce will be affected and instead tauntingly asks reps from Ghost Gunner, by name, to share their own analysis.<br/><br/>Did ATF rely on factors Congress did not intend the agency to consider?<br/>Yes. Congress explicitly states in Sec. 101 of the GCA: \\&quot;it is not the purpose of this title to place any undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with the respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms..\\&quot; and \\&quot;this title is not intended to discourage the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens.\\&quot; ATF makes no analysis of how the definitions, without tailoring, might contradict GCA or discourage the private ownership of firearms<br/><br/>Did ATF fail to consider important aspects of the problem?<br/>Yes. ATF failed to include any Second Amendment analysis. Further, since ATF would award itself the power to determine when a component has become a firearm based on included \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; or a firm\\&#39;s \\&quot;marketing,\\&quot; ATF failed to include a First Amendment analysis. Further still, ATF fails to offer a Fifth Amendment analysis of its purposefully opaque sample submission process.<br/><br/>Is ATF\\&#39;s explanation counter to the evidence?<br/>Yes. Press accounts from 2021 show groups like Everytown met with the White House to lobby for an ATF reinterpretation of the word \\&quot;firearm\\&quot;. We see ATF\\&#39;s prior regulatory rationale on the \\&quot;partially complete receiver\\&quot; question in City of Syracuse, NY, v. ATF, 1:20-cv-06885 (SDNY) and State of California v. ATF, 3:20-cv-06761 (N.D. Cal.). But the rule has no treatment of this ATF record. We may reasonably conclude this rule is made at the direction of activist elements outside of the ordinary legal and administrative center of the agency.<br/><br/>Did ATF consider all regulatory alternatives?<br/>No. The Wall Street Journal published a story recounting a 2021 meeting ATF leadership arranged with the wider firearms industry, where the \\&quot;ghost gun\\&quot; question and this rule were discussed. So rushed was this agency to publication that there is no mention of any one of the regulatory alternatives proposed by the industry.<br/><br/>Did ATF adequately explain its massive \\&quot;flip flop\\&quot; on 80% receivers?<br/>No. ATF hides from its public record of decades of determination letters, produced in City of Syracuse, NY, v. ATF, 1:20-cv-06885 (SDNY) and State of California v. ATF, 3:20-cv-06761 (N.D. Cal.). The agency does not explain if it is judicially estopped from withdrawing these. ATF is so cowardly that in 100 pages it would rather *imply* the overturning of these letters and ask commenters if they believe a flip flop has even occurred. This is shameless and deserves chapters of explanation.<br/><br/>In these more than 100 pages we see a textbook demonstration of undisciplined, bureaucratic decision-making. The new definitions of \\&quot;partially complete receiver\\&quot; and \\&quot;readily\\&quot; guarantee arbitrary and capricious outcomes and threaten a host of activity, commercial and non-commercial, protected by the Second Amendment. This proposed rule ignores the realities of the design and engineering process, how marking of components in an \\&quot;active state of manufacture\\&quot; is actually performed by real manufacturers and producers, and it incentivizes technical developments that will create an even worse black market of untraceable firearms, contrary to the rule\\&#39;s stated goals.<br/><span style='padding-left: 30px'></span>\n"

I strongly oppose this new rule. I am a law-abiding gun owner, but this new rule will make it impossible for me to know whether any given firearm or product is legal. I don&rsquo;t want to go to jail just because a product that was legal is suddenly declared illegal based on an arbitrary decision by the ATF. I strongly oppose this rule&rsquo;s new definition of &lsquo;firearm.&rsquo; This new definition of &lsquo;firearm&rsquo; is vague, dangerous, and will sow confusion throughout the firearms industry. For example, there&rsquo;s no way to know what the ATF means by &lsquo;readily converted.&rsquo; As an executive branch agency, the ATF should not be creating new laws, which is effectively what this rule does. Such decisions should be left to Congress. The vast majority of gun owners are law abiding citizens. This new definition could cause many law abiding citizens to be criminals. This new rule is ambiguous and gives the ATF too much power in determining what a firearm is. It should be clear and concise like it is right now. Leave the definition to Congress. Please rescind this arbitrary proposed rulemaking. Thank you. \n",

I am, and always have been, a law-abiding gun owner, despite the constant and consistent overreach of state and local government. Now, I could be labeled a felon simply because an arbitrary ruling by an organization that does not make laws, decided that an upper receiver is now a regulated component of a firearm. The current laws on the regular of completed firearms and/or receivers, while highly arbitrary, are at least coherent. The ambiguity of these proposed classifications of firearm parts will only lead to confusion and, more likely, well-meaning American citizens becoming felons with firearm convictions. As we know, the court has never allowed ignorance to be a defense. If the ATF is complacent in this fact, it would follow that their goal is to harass and arrest American citizens, not stop the illegal sale and possession of firearms. Criminal have never been the end target for firearm regulation, because criminals don&#39;t follow rules, by definition. Criminals also aren&#39;t hiding away in basements, building ghost guns. Gun building has always been a hobbyist endeavor; criminals have no need to take part. There are an abundance of illegal firearms on the gray and black markers, so implying that a legislation aimed at ensnaring gun owners for firearm components is going to do anything to combat illegal gun ownership and use, is asinine.\n",

During a time in our country where Americans are already on edge for a variety of reasons one of which being an administration that has proven to be untrustworthy, people are buying and making firearms now more than ever. The demand is high and prices are soaring, making receivers, parts, etc. unobtainable for those who do not work in the firearms industry and do not have the connections necessary to make, build, or buy whatever they please. Changing these rules only hurts citizens from exercising the rights to keep and bear arms. This country wasn&rsquo;t built on asking permission, we didn&rsquo;t ask king George  if it might be ok to become our own nation. We told him and all of his red coat friends to leave and never come back, then when they chose to stay patriots of this country made built and bought arms to fight over this piece of dirt we stand on today.

I am dexterous in various hobby crafts, better than average, and I disagree that I can readily complete an 80% receiver, having attempted with the best quality jigs and tools I on the market.  An average attorney could produce ample expert witnesses to prove my claim, and I could produce ruined 80% receivers.  An incomplete receiver is a non-firearm, and words can&#39;t make it one.  I maintain I have the right to purchase non-firearms without government regulation.\n",

            "-------------       This new definition of &lsquo;firearm&rsquo; is vague, dangerous, and will sow confusion throughout the firearms industry. For example, there&rsquo;s no way to know what the ATF means by &lsquo;readily converted.&rsquo; If a 3D printer can make simple parts that turn a Nerf gun into a functioning firearm, do all Nerf guns fall under ATF control?\n",
            "-------------      This change would mean that any piece of pipe capable of accepting a rimmed cartridge would qualify as a receiver. Likewise, there are many ways this rule could be applied such that it would implicate hardware available in stores such as Lowe&rsquo;s and Home Depot. Additionally this rule change seeks to bypass the current understanding of regulatory definitions in order to increase the number of convictions, a frivolous aim that would impact millions of firearms already in circulation. It would also impose an unreasonable burden on licensees dealing in AR-15 upper receivers. Finally, the desire to increase the time that licensees have to maintain records serves only to have a suppressive effect on a licensing scheme that drives the ability of citizens of the United States to exercise the core of a fundamental right.\n",
